# 🚆 City Life in Metro (OpenGL Project)

## 🌟 Introduction
Welcome to **City Life in Metro**, an OpenGL-based Computer Graphics project that simulates a dynamic urban environment featuring a moving metro, animated traffic, and environmental transitions like day and night cycles. This project showcases fundamental and advanced OpenGL techniques such as animation, transformations, and event handling.

## 🎮 Features
- **Metro Movement** 🚆: The train moves from one side of the screen to another with smooth animation.
- **Traffic System** 🚦: Traffic lights change between Red, Orange, and Green, affecting vehicle movement and sounds.
- **Animated Vehicles** 🚗: Cars move in both directions, with an option to reverse their motion.
- **Environmental Effects** 🌆: The sky transitions between different colors, simulating day and night.
- **Sound Effects** 🔊: Metro and traffic sounds play dynamically based on conditions.
- **User Interactions** ⌨️: Control train speed, direction, and scene changes using keyboard inputs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++** 💻 – Core programming language
- **OpenGL (GLUT, GLU)** 🎨 – Graphics rendering
- **Windows API (PlaySound)** 🔊 – Audio effects
- **GLUT Keyboard & Timer Functions** ⏳ – Animation and event handling

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Install OpenGL and GLUT** (if not already installed).
2. **Compile the project** using a C++ compiler that supports OpenGL (e.g., MinGW, Visual Studio).
3. **Run the executable** and enjoy the simulation.

### 💡 **Future Improvements**
- Implement more environmental interactions (e.g., rain, snow). 🌧️❄️
- Add more complex AI for traffic control. 🚦
- Enhance graphics with shaders for better lighting effects. ✨


Feel free to contribute to this project and make it even better! 🚀😊
